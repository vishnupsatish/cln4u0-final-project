            <p id="i" class="fs-3">Introduction</p>
            <p>For my final project for grade 12 law, I decided to do an in-depth analysis of the Quebec City Mosque
                shooting case. </p>
            <p>Earlier in the course, as part of the criminal law unit, I wrote a report on the ruling of
                Bissonnette's sentencing by the trial judge and the appeal judge. The report is shown below.</p>
            <div class="ratio ratio-16x9 responsive-iframe mb-3 mt-3">
                <object class="pdf" type="application/pdf" data="assets/Criminal Case.pdf"></object>
            </div>
            <p>But numerous unanswered questions remained. Should a distinction be made between crimes in which someone
                commits one murder and crimes in which there are multiple murders committed by someone? Should the basis
                of unconstitutionality be the
                discretion provided to give a grossly proportionate sentence, or the sentence itself?</p>
            <p>I needed a plan. First, I was going to read the original sentencing, the appeal, and the Supreme Court
                case (again). This time, I would take notes so I wouldn't forget essential points from the documents. I
                would
                then create a list of questions about the case, s. 745.51, and how they relate to Canadian law.
                Finally, I would find an expert in the subject to interview who would answer the questions.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p id="rtn" class="fs-3">Reading and taking notes on the case</p>
            <p>The first step was to read all three critical documents on the case (original trial, defence appeal,
                Crown
                appeal) and take notes on them. These documents can be found on <a href="https://canlii.org"
                    target="_blank">CanLII</a>. I was also recommended to read a <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://digitalcommons.schulichlaw.dal.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1727&context=scholarly_works">report</a>
                on why s. 745.51 should never be rewritten.</p>
            <p>While reading these documents, I took notes that covered the essential points. These
                notes
                are presented below.</p>

                <object class="pdf" type="application/pdf" data="assets/745.51 Notes.pdf"></object>
            </div>
            <p>Taking notes helped me understand and retain the information presented in the case and report to a
                greater
                depth.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p id="crq" class="fs-3">Creating relevant questions</p>
            <p>Contrary to my initial belief, composing relevant questions was one of the more complicated aspects of
                this
                summative. This is because it involved creative thought and not just pure problem-solving or analytical
                thinking.</p>
            <p>I spent a good while thinking of relevant questions that I could ask aside from the immediate ones that
                came into my head. Eventually, I came up with a list of ten questions to ask, and these are shown below.
            </p>

        <div>
            <p id="fe" class="fs-3">Finding experts</p>
            <p>After reading the case and coming up with relevant questions, I had to find experts to interview. I
                mainly targeted law professors and Crown lawyers, as their emails were the easiest to find. In total, I
                emailed around 30 experts.</p>
            <p>I received more responses than I expected. Responses were a mixed bag. Some stated that
                criminal law was not their expertise, some noted that the timeline was too tight, and others
                agreed to an interview.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately (this is a good problem), there were too many affirmative responses! One Crown
                lawyer and two professors agreed to an interview. By the time the Crown lawyer agreed, I had already
                spoken to two professors, so I thanked the lawyer and informed her that I wouldn't need her help
                anymore.</p>
            <p>The initial email I drafted to send to experts is shown below.</p>

                <p>The first professor that kindly agreed to speak to me was Professor Steve Coughlan of Dalhousie
                    Unversity. His expertise includes criminal law, criminal expertise, and law and its relation to
                    technology. In 2019, he was ranked in the top 25 most influential in the justice system by the
                    magazine Canadian Lawyer.</p>
                <p>The meeting occurred at 10:30 AM on Monday, June 20, 2022. Below is a recording of the meeting.</p>

                <p id="cr" class="fs-3">Concluding remarks</p>
                <p>Being a person who has avoided social science courses due to the ambiguity that exists in them, I've
                    come to understand that ambiguity is unavoidable when dealing with humans (especially a group of
                    humans).</p>
                <p>After meeting with Professor Coughlan, I connected his points with the concepts of natural
                    law and positive law that we learned about earlier in the course. This connection was an "aha"
                    moment for me;
                    as I wrote the initial report and came into these meetings and this case solely thinking about the
                    natural law perspective that law is about what humans feel is right or wrong. Professor Chiao's
                    response to the final question I asked reinforced the belief that positive law is more important
                    than I initially believed, since both can influence one another. It's not just natural law
                    that impacts positive law.</p>
                <p>In general, Professor Coughlan's responses tended to be strictly on the legal side of things (how the
                    law
                    is presently), such as his point that 745.51 prevented the consideration of rehabilitation, which is
                    why it was struck
                    down. For the one morality-related question I asked him (about whether the added part to 745.51 was
                    correct), he mentioned that it requires empirical study, research, and consultation to
                    make that decision. It's not solely a decision of public opinion or the morals of the majority, it's
                    also about considering the statistical and factual aspects and effects of enacting a law.</p>
                <p>Professor Chiao tended to tie his answers back to legal theory and Canadian law. I don't think he
                    answered many of the questions outright, instead he explained why things are the way they are. For
                    example, when I asked whether 25 years as a minimum sentence for first-degree murder is
                    considered a constitutional violation, he said it could be. Still, the Parliament has to enforce
                    some
                    minimums/maximums. He also went into depth about how there is
                    never a consensus on morals which is why the Parliament should make decisions on laws.
                    Total standardization is also difficult to enforce and is something that cannot be achieved in a
                    democracy.</p>
                <p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed speaking to both professors, and learned not only about s. 745.51, but
                    also about the way Canadian law works.</p>
