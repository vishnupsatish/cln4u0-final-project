            <p id="i" class="fs-3">Introduction</p>
            <p>For my final project for grade 12 law, I decided to do an in-depth analysis on the Quebec City Mosque
                shooting case. </p>
            <p>Earlier in the course, as part of the criminal law unit, I wrote a report on the ruling of
                Bissonnette's sentencing by the trial judge and the appeal judge. The report is shown below.</p>
            <div class="ratio ratio-16x9 responsive-iframe mb-3 mt-3">
                <object class="pdf" type="application/pdf" data="assets/Criminal Case.pdf"></object>
            </div>
            <p>But numerous unanswered questions remained. Should a distinction be made between crimes in which someone
                commits one murder and someone commits numerous murders? Should the basis of unconstitutionality be the
                discretion provided to give a grossly proportionate sentence, or the sentence itself?</p>
            <p>I needed a plan. First, I was going to read the original sentencing, the appeal, and the Supreme Court
                case
                (again). This time, I would take notes so I wouldn't forget important points from the documents. I would
                then create a list of questions I had about the case, s. 745.51, and how they relate to Canadian law.
                Finally, I would find an expert in the subject to interview who would answer the questions.</p>

        <div>
            <p id="rtn" class="fs-3">Reading and taking notes on the case</p>
            <p>The first step was to read all three important documents on the case (original trial, defense appeal,
                Crown
                appeal) and take notes on them. These documents can be found on <a href="https://canlii.org"
                    target="_blank">CanLII</a>. I was also recommended to read a <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://digitalcommons.schulichlaw.dal.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1727&context=scholarly_works">report</a>
                on why s. 745.51 should never be rewritten.</p>
            <p>While reading these documents, I took notes that covered the important points conveyed by them. These
                notes
                are presented below.</p>
            <div class="ratio ratio-16x9 responsive-iframe mb-3 mt-3">
                <object class="pdf" type="application/pdf" data="assets/745.51 Notes.pdf"></object>
            </div>
            <p>Taking notes helped me understand and retain the information presented in the case and report to a
                greater
                depth.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p id="crq" class="fs-3">Creating relevant questions</p>
            <p>Contrary to my initial belief, composing relevant questions was one of the harder aspects of this
                summative. This is because it involved creative thought and not just pure problem-solving or analytical
                thinking.</p>
            <p>I spent a good while thinking of relevant questions that I could ask aside from the immediate ones that
                came into my head. Eventually, I came up with a list of ten questions to ask. These are shown below.</p>
            <div class="ratio ratio-16x9 responsive-iframe mb-3 mt-3">
                <object class="pdf" type="application/pdf" data="assets/Questions.pdf"></object>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p id="fe" class="fs-3">Finding experts</p>
            <p>After reading the case and coming with relevant questions to ask, I had to find experts to interview. I
                mainly targeted law professors and Crown lawyers, as their emails were the easiest to find. In total, I
                emailed around 30 experts.</p>
            <p>I received more responses than I expected. Responses were a mixed bag. Some responded stating that
                criminal law was not their expertise (although they had it in their list of interests on their
                university profile??), some responded saying the timeline was too tight, and others agreed to
                an interview.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately (this is a good problem to have), there were too many affirmative responses! One Crown
                lawyer and two professors agreed to an interview. By the time the Crown lawyer agreed, I had already
                spoken to two professors, so I thanked the lawyer and informed her that I wouldn't need her help
                anymore.</p>

            <div>
                <p id="profcoughlan" class="fs-5">Professor Steve Coughlan</p>
                <p>The first professor that kindly agreed to speak to me was Professor Steve Coughlan of Dalhousie
                    Unversity. His expertise includes criminal law, criminal expertise, and law and its relation to
                    technology. In 2019, he was ranked in the top 25 most influential in the justice system by the
                    magazine Canadian Lawyer.</p>
                <p>The meeting occurred at 10:30 AM on Monday June 20, 2022. Below is a recording of the meeting.</p>

                <p>I didn't think there was really a need to transcribe everything that was said, as I believed that the
                    content was better served through the video format. I did, however, take notes after the meeting.
                    Presented below are the notes.
