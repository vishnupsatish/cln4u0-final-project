        <p>For my final project for grade 12 law, I decided to do an in-depth analysis on the Quebec City Mosque
            shooting case. Earlier in the course, as part of the criminal law unit, I wrote a report on the ruling of
            Bissonnette's sentencing by the trial judge and the appeal judge. the report is shown below.</p>
        <div class="ratio ratio-16x9 responsive-iframe mb-3 mt-3">

        </div>
        <p>But numerous unanswered questions remained. Should a distinction be made between crimes in which someone
            commits one murder and someone commits numerous murders? Should the basis of unconstitutionality be the
            discretion provided to give a grossly proportionate sentence, or the sentence itself?</p>
        <p>I needed a plan. First, I was going to read the original sentencing, the appeal, and the Supreme Court case (again). This time, I would take notes so I wouldn't forget important points from the documents. I would then create a list of questions I had about the case, s. 745.51, and how they relate to Canadian law. Finally, I would find an expert in the subject to interview who would answer the questions.</p>
